Question 4
===========

**Develop a program to perform the following task:**  
- Define a function to check whether a number is happy or not.  
- Define a function to print all happy numbers within a range.  
- Define a function to print first N happy numbers.  

**A happy number is a number defined by the following process:**
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.  
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.  
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.  

>**Note: if a number is not being happy after 100 iterations, consider it sad**
